This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Incomplete
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Day 5| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete

## Project Description

A map thst teaches you about all the countries in the would. You click on a localtion in the map and it brings up information about that place. An Online Passport..Keps tracks of all the places you've been and would like to go.

## Wireframes

## Priority Matrix

Be able to provide information to users based on the countries the clicked on.
Create a component that stores info of all the places a person would like to go.
Create another component of all the places they have been.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min



#### SAMPLE.....
#### MVP

Create another component of all the places they have been.

#### PostMVP 

Have People be able to upload pictures

## React Architectural Design

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

#### [SAMPLE FROM A MAP BASED PROJECT](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjtpejbw/image/upload/v1540221204/20181022_111216.jpg)

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 
| WillTravel| Renders user information on all the places that they've indicated they would like to go. | 
|  Traveled | Render user information on all the places they've traveled to. | 
|  Map | Renders information about that country and users can put it on a traled or would like to travel bucket | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| WillTravel| H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs |
|Traveled | H | 7hrs| 2.5hrs |
|  Map | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 
 
 #### SAMPLE.....
| Library | What it Does | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Bootstrap | Used to help style my application | 
| Giphy API | Used to get gifs to use |
