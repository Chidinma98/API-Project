## React Architectural Design

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.
Map Component
Traveled Component
Travling Component

#### [SAMPLE FROM A MAP BASED PROJECT](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjtpejbw/image/upload/v1540221204/20181022_111216.jpg)

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 
| WillTravel| Renders user information on all the places that they've indicated they would like to go. | 
|  Traveled | Render user information on all the places they've traveled to. | 
|  Map | Renders information about that country and users can put it on a traled or would like to travel bucket | 



#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| WillTravel| H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 1 day
|Traveled | H | 7hrs| 2.5hrs |1 day
|  Map | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 2 days

#### SAMPLE.....
```
function reverse(string) {
	// This function allows users to put countries on their wishlist.

     handleTraveledToggle(place) {
    let newTraveledArray = [...this.state.traveled]
    newTraveledArray.push(place)
    this.setState({
      traveled: newTraveledArray
    })



  }
}
```

## Change Log
 I changed the names on the navigation bar. However, it still takes you to the same link. It just made more sense to do it that way

#### SAMPLE.....
| Original Plan | Outcome | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Have one Book component | Split that component into BookInfo and BookInteraction as the component grew too complicated | 

## Issues and Resolutions
 There was an issue with passing a prop between child and parent using methods. However, this problem was eradicated when I refactored everything.
